# Lesson 8.10 - Introduction to Redux

## Lesson Overview

### Key Terms:

- Redux
- Redux Dev Tools
- immutability
- store
- reducers
- actions
- `createStore()`
- `getStore()`
- `combineReducers()`

### Essential Questions:

- What are the benefits of using Redux?
- Which functional programming concepts are present in the implementation of Redux in a web application?
- How does Redux affect application state?
- What is a typical flow of data in a React + Redux application?

### Learning Assignments:

- Learn about the [Motivation behind building Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/motivation), the [Core Concepts](https://redux.js.org/introduction/core-concepts), and the [Three Principles](https://redux.js.org/introduction/three-principles).
- Skim and bookmark documentation to the [`createStore()` API](https://redux.js.org/api/createstore), [`getStore()`](https://redux.js.org/api/store#getstate) and [`combineReducers()`](https://redux.js.org/api/combinereducers)
- Read the [basic tutorial](https://redux.js.org/basics/basic-tutorial) about redux in the Redux docs, which uses a to-do list example.
- Watch or code along with any redux topics you'd like to dive deeper on through this ["Getting Started with Redux"](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux) video series on Egghead.io. For this lesson, do not pass the video on [Passing the Store Down](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-redux-passing-the-store-down-implicitly-via-context)
- OPTIONAL: Download the [Redux Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en) extension, which will be used more in future lessons.

### Practice:

After completing the learning assignments, answer the [short answer questions](practice/short_response.md).

Next create a new version of counter app using class components and incorporating redux to handle state.

- cd `counter-2`.
- Run `npm install` and `npm start` in one termnial.
- Open a second terminal and run `npm test`.

Follow the tests in order to successful create this application.
